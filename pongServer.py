# Use this file to write your server logic
# You will need to support at least two clients
# You will need to keep track of where on the screen (x,y coordinates) each paddle is, the score

# I suggest you use the sync variable in pongClient.py to determine how out of sync your two
# clients are and take actions to resync the games
